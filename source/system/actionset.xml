    <para>
           Actionsets are a way to capsulate many actions with specific options into some kind of a package.
    </para>
    <para>
           For example if you use PHP\Manipulator as part of your build or deploy-process, you can create an actionset which runs all your actions with specified parameters.
           Or you can define an Actionset which forms you own Coding-Guidelines to automatically format your Code according to you defined set of Actions.
